# Simulated_Annealing_Search
The goal of this project is to minimize an objective function by using the probabilistic optimization approach known as simulated annealing. By using a "cooling" strategy, the method searches a large solution space before eventually convergently arriving at the best solution.

##  Features

- **Simulated Annealing Algorithm**: A robust optimization method for finding global minima in complex functions.
- **Visualization of the Optimization Path**: Visual tracking of the solution search process in 3D plot.

##  Optimization Process

In order to investigate potential solutions, the Simulated Annealing method progressively lowers randomness, or temperature, which results in a more focused search later on.

##  Visualization

The 3D visualizations provided in the notebook show the progression of the search across the solution space, allowing users to observe how the algorithm explores and converges on the optimal solution.
